# My Project

## Components

In this project, I've created several reusable components that enhance my UI. Each component comes with its own documentation to help me remember how to use them effectively.

Hereâ€™s a quick reference:

- [Button](./app/components/Button/README.md) - A customizable button component that I can style and use throughout my app.
- [DateRange](./app/components/DateRange/README.md) - A component that formats and displays a date range.
- [DndNestList](./app/components/Dnd/NestList/README.md) - A component that allows me to implement a drag-and-drop interface for reordering an items list.
- [Input](./app/components/Input.md) -A flexible input field component that can handle various input types and validations.
- [LinkC](./app/components/LinkC/README.md) - A reusable and flexible link component that handles internal, external, `mailto:`, and `tel:` links.
- [Positioner](./app/components/Positioner.md) - A handy component for positioning elements in different corners of the viewport, making my layout more dynamic.
- [Spinner](./app/components/Spinner/README.md) - component is a simple, customizable loading indicator that can be used independently or as part of other components.
